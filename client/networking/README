All of this is just me thinking and is open for change.

1. This server client will be set as a Two-tier modular client architecture.

2. What I will provide is an API for communicating with the server.
The API will use a struct to communicate with the server. This struct will be passed to most of the API calls and will be used as the transport bucket.


NOTE: Most of the code will be used for my (Lee) testing to ensure the server works.

The final client code will be in the client/client, the code here is the networking API but will also have client testing code for me
