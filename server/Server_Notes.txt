Server need to:
Make sure only X amount of clients connect
Keep count of online users
Hold DeepSix elections


Recieve struct (Name/MAJORVERSION/MINORVERSION)


Proposed Structs:

NOTE: This is to be used only during connection, one established will use Chat struct
Connect(
string username
int major-version
int minor-version
sAddr ipaddress????

)

ConenctACK(
int Status //0 means OK, 1 means have some username and pick a new one, 2 means too full, try gain later
int id // this is the server ID that is given to the client
)


NOTE: Client is in charge of encoding emp or bold in message, NOT THE SERVER
Chat(
string originator
int status - status bits will be defined later
int message length //this will allow the message to be as long as possible and for TCP to do the backwork of breaking it up
string message
)
